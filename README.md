This is a hardware implementation of the UART protocol using the HDL programming language Verilog. The words transferred from the UART channel will be displayed in four 7-segment LED displays.

The objectives of this project are:
- Implement the 7-segment decoder and the logic behind which of the four screens to select each time
- Implement the UART Transceiver 
- Integrate the UART Transceiver with the LED display
- Add a simple encoding method on the transmitted data for security
